I use a combination of methods from psychology, neuroscience, and statistics to examine how brain plasticity, memory, and mood are affected by mild traumatic injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.

I am also passionate about using machine learning to accelerate my research via insights extracted from epidemiological studies. To this end I collaborate with researchers at the University of Victoria, McMaster University, and the [IALSA](https://www.ialsa.org/) research network to examine how environmental and lifestyle factors affect mental health and morbidity risk in epidemiological studies such as the [Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging](https://www.clsa-elcv.ca/).

In my free time I enjoy coding, reading, biking, hiking, playing guitar, listening to live music, and visiting with friends and family.
