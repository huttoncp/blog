I am senior behavioural scientist with the Province of British Columbia's [Behavioural Insights Group](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/behavioural-insights). My diverse training in applied statistics, neuroscience, and experimental psychology leads me to apply a multidisciplinary and creative approach to doing research. I deeply enjoy solving complex problems and exploring new ideas.

Iâ€™ve worked both as an independent contributor and as a leader of teams of up to 10. In my current role with the Province of British Columbia I primarily work in R.

In my free time I enjoy yoga, hiking, skiing, gaming, coding, reading, travel, live music, and visiting with friends and family.
