I am a data scientist and lead investigator with the Province of British Columbia's [Data Innovation Program](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/about-data-management/data-innovation-program/projects). My diverse training in applied statistics, behavioural neuroscience, and epidemiology leads me to apply a multidisciplinary and creative approach to doing research. I deeply enjoy solving complex problems and exploring new ideas.

Iâ€™ve worked both as an independent contributor and as a leader of teams of up to 10. In my current role as a Data Scientist with the Province of British Columbia I primarily work in R and SQL.

In my free time I enjoy coding, gaming, reading, biking, hiking, playing guitar, listening to live music, and visiting with friends and family.
