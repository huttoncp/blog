I am a Senior Behavioural Scientist with the Province of British Columbia's [Behavioural Insights Group](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/behavioural-insights). I also teach an introductory [data analysis course](https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/data-computing-and-technology/courses/data-analytics-coding-fundamentals) at the University of Victoria and occasionally work as a data science consultant for the [Winstanley Laboratory](https://winstanleylab.psych.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. My diverse training in experimental psychology, applied statistics, and data science leads me to apply a multidisciplinary and creative approach to doing research. I deeply enjoy solving complex problems and exploring new ideas.

Iâ€™ve worked both as an independent contributor and as a leader of teams of up to 10. In my current role with the Province of British Columbia I primarily work in R.

In my free time I enjoy yoga, hiking, skiing, gaming, coding, reading, travel, live music, and visiting with friends and family.
