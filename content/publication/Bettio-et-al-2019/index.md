abstract: Synaptic plasticity is an experience-dependent process that results in
long-lasting changes in synaptic communication. This phenomenon stimulates
structural, molecular, and genetic changes in the brain and is the leading
biological model for learning and memory processes. Synapses are able to show
persistent increases in synaptic strength, or long-term potentiation (LTP), as
well as persistent decreases in synaptic strength, known as long-term depression
(LTD). Understanding the complex interactions that regulate these
activity-dependent processes can provide insight for the development of
strategies to improve cognitive function. Twenty years ago, we provided the
first evidence indicating that aerobic exercise can reliably enhance LTP, and
went on to show that it can also regulate some of the mechanisms involved in LTD
induction. Since then, several laboratories have confirmed and expanded these
findings, helping to identify different molecular mechanisms involved in
exercise-mediated changes in synaptic efficacy. This chapter reviews this
material and shows how these experimental findings may prove valuable for
alleviating the burden of neurodegenerative diseases in an aging population.
